Installing Free Python Games is simple with pip:
```
python -m pip install freegames
```
Free Python Games supports a command-line interface (CLI). Help for the CLI is available using:
```
python -m freegames --help
```
The CLI supports three commands: list, copy, and show. For a list of all games run:
```
python -m freegames list
```
Any of the listed games may be played by executing the Python module from the command-line. To reference the Python module, combine `freegames` with the name of the game. For example, to play the `snake` game run: `pranav`
```
python -m freegames.snake
```
Games can be modified by copying their source code. The copy command will create a Python file in your local directory which you can edit. For example, to copy and play the `snake` game run:

```
python -m freegames copy snake
```
```
python snake.py
```
Python includes a built-in text editor named IDLE which can also execute Python code. To launch the editor and make changes to the “snake” game run:
